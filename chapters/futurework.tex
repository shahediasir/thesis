\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
Things to cover here in the future work.

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can I improve the model for thermal conductivity model.
	\item Can include grain boundary growth. Can through in a swelling model.
	\item Studying the stability of U--Mo alloy with respect to temperature, which can be studied using ab initio molycular dynamcis.
	\item Collecting all the rate limiting steps of xenon diffusion in u--mo alloys.
	\item Come up with a kinetic Monte Carlo Method.
	\item Improve the model somehow , I don't know how.


\end{itemize}
