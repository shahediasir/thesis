\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have studied the impact of fission gas in U--Mo alloy. The distributed xenon and krypton gas inside the fuel has significant impact on the thermal properties on the fuel. Krypton is also a fission products which constitutes almost 10\% of the fission gas. In comparison to pure xenon bubbles in U--10Mo, their mixture has very little differences. This reaffirms that, xenon contributes the most in the reduction of thermal conductivity. Both intra- and inter-granular xenon bubbles impacts on the heat transfer. The arrangements of the bubbles inside the fuel has significant impact the direction of the heat transfer.
